  abstract={This article examines how communication patterns mediate the influences of values on political participation. We find that the positive effects of postmaterial values on participation are mediated through reading public affairs content in newspapers. In contrast, materialist values negatively affect participation through watching television entertainment. Interpersonal discussion in which disagreement occurs mediates both the positive effect of reading public affairs and the negative effect of materialism on political participation. We also provide what may be a better explanation of the influence of communication patterns on political participation by going beyond acquisition of factual political knowledge. We show that individuals' efforts to think about news and search for additional information and perspectives modify what people "get from" media. Reflecting about news and integrating information from various sources promote better understanding of the political world and may provide a stronger cognitive base for political participation than factual political knowledge.},

This effort is an example of computational thinking (Wing, 2006) in practice, as it involves applying computational techniques to the field of ethics, which has previously been thought of as a purely humanistic endeavor. As this paper explains, automatic classification has potential benefits relative to the surveys and manual content analysis that have previously been used to study human values, with significant promise to revolutionize both information ethics and artificial intelligence.},

  title={Analyzing online political discussion using three models of democratic communication},
  author={Freelon, Deen G},
  journal={New Media \& Society},
  year={2010},
  publisher={SAGE Publications},
  abstract={Research examining online political forums has until now been overwhelmingly guided by two broad perspectives: (1) a deliberative conception of democratic communication and (2) a diverse collection of incommensurable multi-sphere approaches. While these literatures have contributed many insightful observations, their disadvantages have left many interesting communicative dynamics largely unexplored. This article seeks to introduce a new framework for evaluating online political forums (based on the work of Jürgen Habermas and Lincoln Dahlberg) that addresses the shortcomings of prior approaches by identifying three distinct, overlapping models of democracy that forums may manifest: the liberal, the communitarian and the deliberative democratic. For each model, a set of definitional variables drawn from the broader online forum literature is documented and discussed.},

  abstract={Studies of political discussions online have been dominated by approaches that focus exclusively on deliberation, ignoring other equally relevant communication norms. This study conducts a normative assessment of discussion spaces in two prominent web platforms—Twitter hashtags and newspaper comment sections devoted to particular political issues—applying the norms of communitarianism, liberal individualism, and deliberation. The platforms’ distinct design features and users’ left/right issue stances emerge as significant predictors of normative differences.},

  abstract={Human values are increasingly being used as a concept in a wide range of fields including psychology, sociology, anthropology, science and technology studies, and information science. However, the use of this concept varies widely in these different fields, and several different instruments have been developed separately to measure values. This paper reviews research to date on values in all of these fields to develop a definition of values, and then reviews 12 value inventories to create a meta-inventory},

  abstract={This paper investigates the relationship between human values and computational modeling through mixed-method field research at three organizations (corporate, academic, and government research labs). This research builds on research on the role of values in information technology design from science and technology studies, information ethics, and human-computer interaction. Surveys and interviews were used to identify statistically significant differences among modelers in the three organizations both in terms of their self-assessment of their values and in the frequency of value occurrences within specific organizational contexts. Interviews also provided qualitative data that explain the statistically significant differences. Results included a higher value placed on creativity and lower values placed on conformity-related values among researchers in the academic lab. This paper demonstrates that there are statistically significant differences among the values of the modelers employed within the three organizations. Future research involving more sites can generalize the relationship between values and organization type.

  abstract={How can we explain and predict differences in sentiment among different groups of people? Automatic techniques can determine sentiment polarity by labeling
an author’s text as expressing positive, negative, or neutral opinion, but such approaches ignore motivations behind the sentiment. Human values are what determine
an individual’s priorities, and, as such, can help explain why someone has a particular sentiment. We present a theoretical framework and corresponding research program with the goal of scaling up social science text analysis by automatically detecting and classifying human values in texts to explain sentiment. We present two studies with different approaches to machine learning about human values. In the first, which
focuses on the Net neutrality debate, content analysis by experts leads to annotations of values in texts with varying sentiment polarity toward Net neutrality. Machine learning allows leveraging these annotations for automatically detecting human values in texts.},

  abstract={Taking important life decisions is a complex task leading to long-lasting consequences. It requires balancing one's own needs and those of other stakeholders. Current digital decision support focuses little on the human decision-making capabilities. Systems are designed as analytic tools to find optimal outcomes assuming stable and known preferences. However, insights from psychology and behavioral decision research show that people construct preferences during an adaptive decision-making process and are less rational than assumed by current tools. It has been suggested that a stronger focus on personal values could lead to improved decision making, but reflection on values is difficult for people. This paper presents a first exploration of how to aid people in reflecting on their values. It serves as a starting point to develop digital value-focused decision support tools. We describe the design of a probe for value reflection and several studies with experts and end-users that led to a first set of considerations for such tools.},
